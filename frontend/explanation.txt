//User npm install --save react-router-dom@5 --save-exact

npm install: This command is used to install Node.js packages (in this case, the react-router-dom package).

--save: This flag is used to update the dependencies section of your package.json file with the installed package and its version.

react-router-dom@5: This specifies that you want to install version 5 of the react-router-dom package.

--save-exact: This flag ensures that the exact version you specified (in this case, version 5) is saved in your package.json file, 
preventing npm from using newer versions that might be available in the future.

routing to manage routing is react spa application



router parse from top to bottom so have switch to switch to the url when it found the appropriate one.
redirect will redirect to the homepage in case it dose not found a matching route


dumb components has no logic they are presentational

stateful component has state and lifestyle. they are logical in nature




Yes, it's common in a React application to have a single `BrowserRouter` or `HashRouter` wrapping the entire application. This is often done in the root component of your application (e.g., in your `index.js` or `App.js` file). This way, the router can manage the application's navigation globally.

Here's a simple example:

```jsx
// index.js or App.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

In this example, the `Router` component wraps the `App` component, making the routing context available throughout the entire application.

Inside your `App` component or any other component within your application, you can use `Route`, `Switch`, `Link`, and other React Router DOM components to define your Single Page Application (SPA) navigation.

```jsx
// App.js

import React from 'react';
import { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';
import Contact from './Contact';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Navigation Links can be placed here if desired */}
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This is a common pattern for managing routes in a React SPA, and it allows you to keep the overall structure of your routing centralized.
