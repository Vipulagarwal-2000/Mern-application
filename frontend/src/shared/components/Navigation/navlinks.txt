In React Router DOM, `NavLink` is a component that provides a way to create navigation links in your application. It is a special version of the `Link` component with additional styling capabilities for indicating the "active" or "selected" state of the link.

Here's a basic example of how you can use `NavLink` in React Router DOM:

```jsx
import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

const Navigation = () => {
  return (
    <nav>
      <NavLink to="/" exact activeClassName="active">
        Home
      </NavLink>
      <NavLink to="/about" activeClassName="active">
        About
      </NavLink>
      <NavLink to="/contact" activeClassName="active">
        Contact
      </NavLink>
    </nav>
  );
};
```

In this example:

- `to` specifies the path the link should navigate to.
- `exact` is an optional prop that ensures the link is only considered active when the current route exactly matches the `to` prop.
- `activeClassName` is a class name that will be applied to the link when it is active, allowing you to apply specific styles to active links.

By using `NavLink`, you can easily create navigation links that have different styles when they are active, making it clear to the user which part of the application they are currently viewing.

The activeClassName prop in React Router DOM is used to specify a CSS class that will be applied to the NavLink when the link is considered "active" based on the current route.


activeClassName="active" so active is the class.
